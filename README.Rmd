The goal of `acronym` is to help finding acronyms in a Word document so you can create a list of abbreviations for your manuscript submission.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `acronym` from [GitHub](https://github.com/fmmattioni/acronym) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("fmmattioni/acronym")
```

## Example

```{r}
library(acronym)

find_acronyms(path = system.file("zotero.docx", package = "acronym"), ref_manager = "zotero")
```

### Copy it directly into your Word document!

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/demo.gif")
```
